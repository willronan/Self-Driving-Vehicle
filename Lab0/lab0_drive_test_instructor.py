''' Lab0_drive_test.py

This walkthrough is designed to give you a basic understanding of
how to write commands to the QCar's lights, steering servo, and
motor. Please take the time read the code's imports, sampling
general setup, etc. to gain an understanding of coding for QCar in
python

finally:
